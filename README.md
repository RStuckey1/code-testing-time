# Code-Testing Time

## Description

A code testing script using cypress which has both component and e2e tests for the following:

GIVEN I am taking a tech quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN the quiz starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN all questions are answered
THEN the quiz is over
WHEN the quiz is over
THEN I can view my score
WHEN the quiz is over
THEN I can start a new quiz

This was used to write these tests:

1) the page/component successfully loads
2) which I click the start quiz button a question is loaded
3) when I answer a question another question is prompted
4) whhen all questions are answered the quiz is over
5) when the quiz is over the score is viewed
6) when the quiz is over I am able to start a new quiz
